**Project Introduction**

I intend to create a website revolving around the NRT fellowship project I am involved with this year that is focused on investigating the impact of anthropogenic nutrients on the health of Mo’orea (French Polynesia) coral systems. I plan to post initial landcover classification maps of the island on this site, along with background information describing both the region and context of our NRT project. Since our NRT group has discussed creating a website for our project, I intend to keep in mind that this site will likely be expanded (both in scope and to include other student’s project work) over the next few months as I produce the website’s design.

**Potential Datasets Image**
The following is a screen capture image of an ArcMap project displaying a similar suite of data to that proposed for the Mo'orea project, and is derived from a comparable ongoing project at South Georgia Island.
